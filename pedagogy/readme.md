Experiment	Measurement of Power using CT and PT.
 
1.Focus Area : Instrumentation and Practical Skills
By this experiment we want students to understand the connections for measuring the power of the 3-phase circuit by using the current transformer (CT) and potential transformer (PT) by using 3-phase two element wattmeter. After that how to calculate total power consumed in 3-phase load and also % error in calculated power. 

2.Learning Objectives and Cognitive Level
Description: 
There will be a tentative circuit diagram shown in the theory part of the experiment. There will be block diagram of different instruments provided in the simulation and the same will be required to be connected as per the circuit diagram shown in the theoretical part by student while performing the experiment. After completing the circuit diagram students will record the reading of wattmeter by providing the inputs as per circuit diagram. Based on the reading students will calculate the power consumed by the load and finally the % error.
Method:
To achieve attainment of all the objectives the experiment is designed for different sets of input variables so that students can learn through performing.
